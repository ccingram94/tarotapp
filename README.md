# tarotapp âœ¨

This is a refactoring of an old tarot card web app I very unfortunately wrote in PHP and jQuery (it was 2015...).  Now adapted to the Next.js framework with next-auth authentication and framer-motion animations. The cards feature art from the Italian early Renaissance master Giotto.
